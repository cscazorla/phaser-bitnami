# My first videogame using Phaser and Bitnami
A simple example of how to implement a videogame using [Phaser - HTML5 Game Framework](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) and [Bitnami Apache Docker Image](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache) with a docker-compose image.

## TL;DR
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cscazorla/phaser-bitnami.git
cd phaser-bitnami
docker-compose up
```
Access your web server in the browser by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) and start playing.

## Introduction
The main goal of this tutorial is to help people to start developing videogames in the browser. Thanks to Bitnami Docker Images we can forget about setting up the infrastructure (i.e. Apache web server) and focus on developing the game.

This videogame is based on the [Making your first Phaser game tutorial](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game) but it has some extra improvements features like stages (which allows you to organize your code while also adding a more complete and dynamic gaming experience for the player) and a "bad guy" who tries to catch you.

## Next steps
Are you comfortable with this code and you would like to improve the game? Here you are a few challenges:
- Implement a victory message when all Bitnami logos are collected.
- Make the baddie jump randomly when chasing you.

## To Do
- Explain the code base
